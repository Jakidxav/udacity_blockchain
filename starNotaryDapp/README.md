This project is a decentralized star notary dapp service. It allows people to claim and trade stars on the Ethereum blockchain. I used OpenZeppelin's template for the ERC-721 non-fungible token contract, and the Truffle suite to test, compile, and run my code.

- My ERC-721 token name is: `Eth-Star`
- This token's symbol is `STAR`

I am using:
    - `OpenZeppelin` version `2.1.2`
    - `Truffle` version `5.1.48`
